Check Your Understanding:

1. No, you would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application. The messaging feature is made of too many parts. It involves visual design, backend, data storage and other things for it to work. Unit testing is just for testing an individual part of code. It would be better to test the messaging feature with a bigger test that checks how everything works together.

2. Yes, you would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application. Unit testing is used for an individual part of code. This feature simply checks to see if the user is typing more than 80 words. Since it doesn't depend on other parts of code, unit testing can be used.
